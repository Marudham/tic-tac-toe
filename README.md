# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

## Introduction

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. It provides a command-line interface for players to enjoy the classic game. The game supports two modes: player vs. player and player vs. computer.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played directly in the command line, making it easy to run and play.
- **Two Modes**: Players can choose between two modes: player vs. player and player vs. computer.
- **Player vs. Player**: Two players take turns making moves on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Player vs. Computer**: Players can challenge the computer. The computer plays by selecting random valid positions on the board, providing an engaging and unpredictable gameplay experience.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game detects winning conditions, including three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects when the board is full without a winner, resulting in a draw.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java files in the `tictactoe0` package:

   ```bash
   javac tictactoe0/*.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled Java program with the main class:

   ```bash
   java tictactoe0.Main
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the game mode and make moves on the board.
